# Simple simulation

In the following simulations, we generate bipartite networks by first
simulating the corresponding latent space. The latent space, or a
transformation of it, will be use as covariates in the model. The key
difference between simulation settings is not the network generation
method, but the manner in which the available covariates are
incorporated into the model.

# Sampling process simulation

 This simulation study tries to replicate numerically the sampling process taking place in the Spipoll data set. Covariates will be use to explain the observation probabilities. The key difference between simulation settings is not the network generation method, but the manner in which the available covariates are incorporated into the model.
